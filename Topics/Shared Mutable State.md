Shared, mutable. Pick one.

We often talk about the danger of shared mutable state. To avoid this problem, most people mention immutability as a solution. This breaks the combination of sharing and mutabilty. But the problem only occurs at this intersection, when something is both shared and mutable. So avoiding sharing is another way to break this chain. Swift's structs do this - they are copied on assignment, so even if they are mutable, no one else can see the change. This has the same benefits of immutability in simplification and avoiding bugs, but it also has the additional benefit that it avoids some awkardness that pervasive immutability introduces as well (such as immutable data structures. While interesting, they can't beat the performance of a true mutable array).
