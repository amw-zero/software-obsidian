In this article, the author proposes a statistical model of software estimation. He then compares it to some real world data where, on the surface, it matches fairly well.

He introduces the notion of "blowup factor" which is, when you are wrong about an estimation, how much longer it takes. On average, we are good at estimamting things, but the outliers have a blowup factor which exponentially contribute to the actual time taken for a project.
