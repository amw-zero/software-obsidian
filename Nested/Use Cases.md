Use cases are tremendously important. An application is effectively a way to enable use cases. What is the best way to design, structure, and test use cases? 

Use cases can consist of many steps, with intermediate querying along the way. In many cases, the best experience for a use case is a multi-step wizard with the ability to query clarifying data in the interim. This means that a use case can consist of multiple views, and it can perform multiple data requests throughout the process. 

This begs the question: should you test the use case or the individual operations?
