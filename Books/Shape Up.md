# Intro
Growing pains:

“As software teams start to grow, some common struggles appear:

Team members feel like projects go on and on, with no end in sight.

Product managers can’t find time to think strategically about the product.

Founders ask themselves: “Why can’t we get features out the door like we used to in the early days?”
“

Obviously this book is product focused, but the “why can’t we ship features as much” is probably more related to technical structure than product concerns. I think product concerns do play a role - product problems are at the root of some technical problems. But the technical architecture may contribute more to speed in the long run.

Love the notion of “appetite.” Budget is probably a better word. “We’d like to budget 4 weeks for this, and that’s it.” 

# Principles of Shaping
Shaping is a good idea - we are not good at this. Creating boundaries is a great way to stay focused on a small product without trying to solve a tremendous, nebulous problem.

# Set Boundaries
** Fixed time, variable scope ** 

I think this is probably the most important takeaway here. So much tension comes from an unwillingness to accept that we can’t estimate software very accurately. If both the scope and the deadline are not negotiable, we’re forced to rush to meet the deadline, compromising on quality and design. We should have deadlines, because it forces us to act and make decisions - I liked that point too. But we should be much more judicious about our scopes then.
Find the Elements
Love this idea too - I think of UX in this way. “Deal Profile” - “Deal List” - these are elements that can be configured in different ways. The elements are what’s important, not the specific design. Design should be free to change - big implications on testing too!
Risks and Rabbit Holes
** Speaking of long tail distributions ** !!

I love when other things I’m reading talk about similar things. I’m reading [[Black Swan]] by Nassim Taleb - it’s all about how we misuse averages and totally misunderstand statistics and probability. When there is a long tail in a distribution, the outliers can have an immense impact on the outcome. We see this in VTS. The largest clients have the most data, but they are the outliers in terms of data volumen. Yet they cause the most timeouts!

Also: [[Software Estimation, a Statistical Model]]. Software estimation has a long tail, so even if we are rarely wrong, when we are wrong we can be off by weeks and not days.
