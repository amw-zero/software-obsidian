[[Permutations and Combinations]] show up all over the place. For example, the universe of behaviors of a program is equal to all of the paths through the program for all of the combinations of all inputs.

Graph theory is fundamental to computer science. A program is a control flow graph at the lowest level, one level higher is the call graph, and another level higher is the module dependency graph. Understanding graphs and their properties is essential to understanding software.
